## Bachelor of Science (BSc)

In 2014 I started the Bachelor of Science in computer science at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern
Switzerland.  
In this course of study I had the opportunity to sharpen the knowledge collected in the high school and also to learn
new methodologies and technologies.

I followed a 4 years professional Bachelor path, I took the courses in parallel with a professional activity.    
I was employed for the 80% of the time and attended the courses in two evenings a week and on Fridays all day.

The Bachelor thesis consisted in a Java platform that orchestrate all the IT access in the various applications of my
employer, coupled with a javascript web application. This work has been graded 5.7.

## Master of Science (MSc)

In the 2019 I started a Master of Science in engineering with the specialization in Internet Of Things. Similarly to the
Bachelor I'm currently following the Master in parallel to a professional employment, right now working at an occupation
of 100%

As for now (2022) I just need to finish my master thesis, which is consist of building an Asset Administration Shell
that keep an eye on the worker, de facto embracing the human in the loop paradigm.

## High School apprenticeship

My journey starts in the 2009 when I started the Scuola Professionale Artigianale e Industriale (in english "
Professional craft and industrial school") in Locarno. Here I laid the foundations of my experience following the
computer sciences course with the specialization in software development.

The format of this school expect also to be employed as apprenticeship in a related field, thus to apply the learned
notions directly on real use-cases.

In additional I have integrated the vocational baccalaureate in technology, which allows the students to continue the
studies attending a bachelor course in a professional university.

At the end of this course of study, in 2013, I have obtained federal certificate of ability in computer science and the
vocational baccalaureate in technology.
