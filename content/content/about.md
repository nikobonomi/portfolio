My name is Niko Bonomi, born in 1994 in Lugano, Switzerland.

I’ve spent the last 12+ years working in different areas of software development including responsive frontends,
developing REST services, industrial machines interfaces and predictive algorithms.

Currently, I’m a Researcher at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI). The research
activities mainly consist in developing REST services coupled with web application portals.

Being part of the team working at SUPSI Mini-Factory, which is a long-term ongoing project within the Institute of
Systems and Technologies for Sustainable Production, I have the opportunity to integrate the aforementioned services
directly within the downstream hardware.

I am daily employed in activities related to local (Switzerland), European and didactic projects. I take part not only
in software development but also in defining the best approach to fulfil the requirements reaching the set research
goals. More information about the projects folder are available here: [Projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "Projects").
