I've spent the last 12+ years working in different areas of software development; developing REST services, responsive
frontends, industrial machines interfaces and predictive algorithms.

Currently, I'm a Researcher at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) in the fields
of Industry 4.0. The research activities mainly consists in developing REST services coupled with a web application
portal.  
I have the opportunity to work within the SUPSI Minifactory at the SPS Lab, where I integrate the aforementioned
services directly within the downstream hardware.

My activities are relative to internal, local (Switzerland) and European projects; where I discuss with the other
project panthers the best approach in reaching the research goals, more about that here:
