## Researcher

After a total of 10 year in the Cantonal Hospital I decided to challenge myself in a new kind of job. In the 2019 I
started working at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland as a Researcher in the field of
Industry 4.0.

Here I started to work with experts in the sector using the last technologies available. My duty is to build from
ground-up, software platforms that are required in the development of local and international projects.

My lines of research are "smart automation" and "Human-centered smart production", I'm active in a variety of projects
ranging from the internals to the europeans ones. Some of my publications are listed here: 
[Research]({{< ref "/research" >}} "Research").

## Software developer

In the 2014, after accomplishing the 4-month compulsory military service, I have been hired as a full time employee
always in EOC. Here I was in charge of integrating the ticketing software (CA Service Desk) with all the others services
and applications that needed an integration with such software.

In parallel, I started a Bachelor of Science degree at SUPSI, reducing my occupation level at 80% to be able to attend
the classes. After that I enrolled a Master of engineering, also in parallel to my working activities.

## Software developer apprenticeship

I started my working experience as a software developer apprentice, in the 2009, for the Cantonal Hospital IT
department (EOC) in Bellinzona. I had the opportunity to work with professionals that trained me in developing using
.NET frameworks. While learning, besides the basics notions, other programming languages like Java, C and Javascript
during the in-class lessons one week each month.
