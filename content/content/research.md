#### 2021 Smart quality control powered by machine learning algorithms

This paper addresses the achievements of the QU4LITY project, funded by the Swiss Innovation Agency. Within this
research project, the automation back-bone developed for the SUPSI MiniFactory, coupled with adaptive Machine Learning (
ML) algorithms, is exploited to test numerous families of bearings. The MiniFactory is associated with an evolving
digital profile, a digital twin, based on constant synchronization through IoT devices, that encompasses a massive,
real-time, real-world data, gathered from the different sensors interfaced via OPC-UA protocol.

#### 2021 Non-intrusive and privacy preserving activity recognition system for infants exploiting smart toys

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) research area showed great advances in the last decade, achieving excellent
prediction performances and great applicability, which is reflected on the wearable sensors marked adoption. In this
paper we present an HAR based solution targeting infants, based on a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving measurement
methodology which allows the preservation of children behaviour and the collection of objective data.
